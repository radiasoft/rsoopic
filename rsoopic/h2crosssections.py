    Selection of after-ionization angles for the primary and secondary electrons
    adapted from XOOPIC's MCCPackage::primarySecondaryAngles routine.

    ## The general idea ##
    The cross-section $\sigma(w, t, \theta)$ dictates the likelihood
    of any given ionization event with incident energy $t$, emission energy $w$, and
    emission angle $\theta$.  We will treat the recoiling primary as though it is
    two separate particles, one before and one after ionization, with energy
    reduced by the ionization energy and what is given to the secondary.

    Note: theta is defined relative to the incident electron trajectory

    We know that:
        $ \int_0^\pi { \sigma(w, t, \theta) * 2\pi sin(\theta) d\theta } = \sigma(t,w) $

    We can then define $F(\theta)$ taking the value $0 <= F(\theta) <= 1$:
        $ F(\theta) = 2\pi \int_0^\theta d\theta' sin(\theta') \frac{\sigma(w, t, \theta')}{\sigma(w,t)} $

    If we can invert this expression to get $\theta$ as a function of $w, t$, and $F(\theta)$, we can
    sample this distribution by choosing a random number for $F(\theta)$ and the known values of $w, t$.

    This inversion is explained in detail in [1].
